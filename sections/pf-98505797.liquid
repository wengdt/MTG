<button class="accordion">What is a novel coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A novel coronavirus is a new strain of virus that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus that causes COVID-19 is different from the coronaviruses that commonly circulate, causing mild illness, like the common cold.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is the disease being called COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for the disease. It means coronavirus disease 2019. Formerly, the disease was referred to as "2019 novel coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV".</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the risk of coronavirus in the UK?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As of March 2020, the risk to the UK has been raised to high. Health professionals are exhibiting continued efforts  to contact anyone who has been in close contact with people who have coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Who is being tested for coronavirus in the UK?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Testing now mostly takes place in hospitals. People with respiratory illness or those in intensive care units will be tested for Covid-19. When there is a cluster of infections in a care home, those people will be tested as well.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is an antibody test?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>An antibody test studies a patient's sample by testing the blood for coronavirus antibodies to see if they have already beaten the virus and gained some immunity to it. Also, it will determine if the patient has had the coronavirus before and has since recovered.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is an antigen test?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>An antigen test determines the presence or absence of an antigen. An antigen is a structure within a virus that triggers the immune system's response to fight off the infection. The antigen tests spot viral proteins in the blood and give quicker results to help identify whether someone has an infection.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How much will the test cost in the UK?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no official information from the government about the cost of a test. However, please note that finger-prick tests by SureScreen, a British company will cost £6.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How does the COVID-19 spread?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Covid-19 is a respiratory virus which is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. This means droplets from an infected person who coughs or sneezes or droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.</p>
<p>It is also believed that people can become infected by touching an object that has the virus on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can the coronavirus disease spread through food?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Current evidence suggests that while coronaviruses appear to be stable at low and freezing temperatures for a certain period, food hygiene and good food safety practices can prevent their transmission through food.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by a coronavirus, you should:</p>
<li>Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu.</li>
<li>Call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the area.</li></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is the COVID-19 virus being transmitted from one person to another?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. Research and reports confirm human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is Covid-19 the same with SARS?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused SARS outbreak in 2003 are related genetically. However, the diseases they cause are different.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is Covid-19 an airborne disease?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no evidence to confirm that Covid-19 is an airborne disease. Airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available data.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of getting infected.</p>
<p>According to critical scientific analysis, coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>COVID-19 seems to behave like other coronaviruses. According to a recent study, COVID-19 may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. The study found that the virus can live for up to 72 hours on plastics, 48 hours on stainless steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper. In addtion, it is also detectable in the air for 3 hours.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the common symptoms of coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The common symptoms of coronavirus include:</p>
<li>A cough</li>
<li>A high temperature</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li></p>
<p>However, having these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do I self-isolate if I am asked to?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you are self-isolating, you must do the following:</p>
<li>Do not leave your home for any reason, other than to exercise once a day</li>
<li>Stay at least 2 metres (3 steps) away from other people</li>
<li>Do not  go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home</li>
<li>Do not invite visitors, such as friends and family, in your home.</li></p>
<p>Self-isolation helps to stop the spread of coronavirus infection. Do not leave your home if you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) or if you live with someone who does.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there a treatment for coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is currently no specific available treatment or vaccine for Covid-19. Antibiotics will not help, as they do not work against viruses.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What should I do if I may have come into contact with someone who has coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you think you have been in close contact with someone with confirmed Covid-19, use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do. You can also call NHS 111 if you cannot get help online.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are face masks useful for preventing coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Face masks play a critical role in places like hospitals, but there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should other people in the household stay away from work or school if a member of the family has returned from China or another infected area?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You do not necessarily need to stay away from work or school if someone you live with has recently come from a country or area with a high coronavirus risk.</p>
<p>Use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the best way to slow the spread of coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds and whenever you:</p>
<p><li>get home or into work</li>
<li>blow your nose, sneeze or cough</li>
<li>eat or handle food</li></p>
<p>It is important to use soap and water or a hand sanitiser.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are face masks useful for preventing coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Face masks play a critical role in places like hospitals, but there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do I need to avoid public transport, mass gatherings, festivals, concerts or places with crowds?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Most people can continue to go to work, school and other public places.
You only need to stay away from public places (self-isolate) if advised to by the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or a medical professional.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do I protect myself from coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>To protect yourself from contracting the coronavirus infection, you must do the following:</p>
<li>Observe good hygiene practices like regularly washing your hands with soap and water for at elast 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Maintain a barrier of physical distance or social distancing</li>
<li>Stay indoors</li>
<li>Put used tissues in the bin straight away and wash your hands afterwards</li>
<li>Try to avoid close contact with unwell people.</li></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the mortality rate of Covid-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Initial study found that the mortality rate for Covdi-19 is at 2%. However, on March 3rd, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that 3.4% of those who are infected with the disease have died from across the globe.</p>
<p>This data may change from time to time. It is too early to determine what the overall mortality rate is.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the recovery period for those who contracted the coronavirus disease?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Based on available preliminary data, the average time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks. For patients with severe cases, the recovery period may last up to 3-6 weeks.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is a mass gathering?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Mass gatherings are events which bring together a large number of people with the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How to use and dispose of a medical mask?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Here are the things to remember when using a medical mask:</p>
<li>Before wearing a medical mask, clean your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Pick up the mask and inspect for tears or holes.</li>
<li>Orient yourself with the top side, where the metal strip is.</li>
<li>Identify the proper side of the mask facing outside, which is the colored side.</li>
<li>Place the mask to your face, pinch the metal strip and mould it to your nose and face.</li>
<li>Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.</li>
<li>After use, take off the mask, remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes.</li>
<li>Do not allow the mask to touch or contaminate surfaces or clothes.</li>
<li>Avoid touching potentially contaminated parts of the mask.</li>
<li>Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water after discarding your mask.</li></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is viral load?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Viral load refers to the total amount of a virus a person has inside of them. It is also the amount of measurable virus in a standard volume of material, such as blood or plasma.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Am I protected against COVID-19 if I had the influenza vaccine this year?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different viruses and the seasonal influenza vaccine will not protect against COVID-19.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>On the one hand, epidemic is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. On the other hand, a pandemic is an epidemic of disease that has spread across a large region or worldwide.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>On the one hand, isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick. On the other hand, quarantine refers to the restriction or separation of movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long will this outbreak last?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict how long the outbreak will last and how the pandemic will unfold. The world is dealing with a new virus, therefore,  a lot of uncertainty remains.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is an airborne disease?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>An airborne disease refers to any disease that is caused by pathogens, which can be transmitted through the air over time and distance by small particles.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I go to the dentist, GP or book another medical appointment?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You can leave home for medical appointments, yet GP practices may postpone non-urgent health checks or routine appointments.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should only go to the doctor if there is an essential medical need.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I walk my dog or look after my horse?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes, provided that you do it alone or with other members of the household.</p>
<p>Although people must stay at home to reduce the risk of infection, you are allowed to go out once a day for a walk, run, or cycle. However, it is essential to stay at least 2 metres away from anyone else that is not from your household.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should I stop going to work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If it is not possible to work from home, you may travel for work purposes. Where possible, employers must ensure providing suitable IT and equipment to enable remote working.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I go out to see my friends?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Here are the things to remember when using a medical mask:</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How to use and dispose of a medical mask?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Staying at home is vital in cutting a link in the chain of transmission.</p>
<p>Although you should not be meeting your friends unless you live in the same household, you could still talk to them through phone and/or video calls.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I visit elderly relatives?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You should not visit family members who do not live in your home, especially those who are at risk, such as the elderly. If you have vulnerable relatives, you may help them in buying their daily needs or assist them in ordering their essentials online. However, you must not enter their home. Instead, you may leave the shopping bags and medication at the door. 
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I go out and help a vulnerable person?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You are allowed to help a vulnerable person if:</p>
<li>You and all members of your household are well.</li>
<li>You are under 70 years old.</li>
<li>You are not pregnant.</li>
<li>You have no long-term health conditions.</li></p>
<p>If the answer is yes to those mentioned above, you may volunteer to care for vulnerable persons. However, it is crucial to be mindful of the guidelines set out by the UK government to ensure your safety.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I move house?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If possible, homebuyers and renters should delay moving to a new house while measures to fight coronavirus are in place.</p>
<p>If moving is inevitable for contractual reasons and both parties are unable to reach an agreement to delay, it is vital to practise social distancing.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If I break the rules, what will happen to me?</button>

<button class="accordion">How efficient are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with Covid-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Thermal scanners are useful in detecting people who have developed a fever, such as those who have a higher than normal body temperature.</p>
<p>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but do not have a fever yet as it takes between 2 and 10 days before they become sick.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Instead, they can be harmful to your clothes and mucous membranes.</p>
<p>Alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces. However, it is vital to use them under appropriate recommendations.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, do not protect against the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Although these vaccines are not effective against Covid-19, vaccinations against respiratory illnesses are highly recommended to protect your health.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can rinsing the nose regularly with saline help prevent coronavirus infection?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is limited evidence that rinsing the nose regularly with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, there is no evidence showing that doing so can protect people from Covid-19.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can eating garlic protect you against Covid-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no scientific research that proves eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the incubation period of the coronavirus disease?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>"Incubation period" refers to the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>The incubation period for Covid-19 is somewhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should I worry about the new coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Generally, Covid-19 infection is mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause severe illness and may be fatal for those who are older, as well as those who have underlying conditions. Thus, it is quite reasonable for people to worry.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities, it is essential to practise regular handwashing and good respiratory hygiene. Also, it is beneficial to follow the advice of local health authorities, particularly towards any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings to reduce the risk of infection effectively.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are pregnant women more at risk of getting infected with Covid-19? Will it harm the baby?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. However, pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes which may make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including Covid-19.</p>
<p>Coronavirus infection spreads mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Also, it is still unknown whether a pregnant woman with Covid-19 can transmit the virus to her baby through other routes of vertical transmission before, during or after delivery.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>For the other coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be reinfected after they recover. However, it is still unknown whether similar immune protection will be observed with those who have recovered from Covid-19.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I buy a private test?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You can, but Public Health England advises against it because there is not yet enough information about its efficiency.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are there any medicines that can prevent or cure COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure COVID-19. However, some western, traditional and home remedies may help alleviate its symptoms.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If there are no hand sanitisers available, can I use ethyl alcohol or liquor?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If hand sanitisers are not available, handwashing with soap and water is an even better alternative. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be useful, it must contain an alcohol content of 60% to 95%. Liquor is ineffective against coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If a lactating mother tests positive, will she still be able to breastfeed her baby?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Lactating mothers can breastfeed if they wish to do so. According to scientific research, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, lactating mothers should follow the guidelines below to ensure the health and wellbeing of their baby:</p>
<li>Practice respiratory hygiene and wear a mask during feeding</li>
<li>Wash hands before and after touching the baby</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces regularly.</li></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are smokers and tobacco users at higher risk of getting infected?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Smokers are more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers and cigarettes are in close contact with the lips. Thus, increasing the possibility of transmission from hand to mouth. Also, they may already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity, which would significantly increase the risk of serious illness.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do any useful antiviral treatments exist?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The question remains open. The World Health Organisation director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, revealed that several trials are looking at the potential use of two HIV drugs as well as another antiviral called Remdesivir that was developed to tackle haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola. </p>
<p>The results may be expected in three to four months. Meanwhile, Columbia University researchers have received a $2m (£1.5m) grant to work on possible antivirals drugs and antibodies to tackle coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What else can I do to ensure I don’t catch coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In addition to practising social distance, you can also follow the measures below to help ensure safety:</p>
<li>Always carry tissues, which you can use to catch your cough or sneeze. After use, bin it and wash your hands with soap and water or sanitiser gel.</li>
<li>Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, especially when you:</li>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">Get home or into work</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">Blow your nose, sneeze or cough</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">Eat or handle food.</div>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with unwell people.</li></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does the WHO agree on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a response to COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The WHO actively follows the ongoing clinical trials to obtain an effective response to COVID-19, which includes the scientific studies that are looking at the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Currently, there is inadequate data to evaluate the efficacy of either of these medicines in treating Covid-19 patients and in preventing people from contracting the coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is WHO’s view on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Several countries are evaluating the use of LPV/r and other antivirals, and the WHO welcomes the results of these investigations. Currently, there is inadequate data to assess the effectiveness of LPV/r or other antivirals in treating Covid-19 patients.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does the WHO say about the use of corticosteroids in treating Covid-19 patients?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The current interim guidance from WHO on the clinical administration of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 infection is presumed advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for different reasons.</p>
<p>This guidance is based on systematic analyses that indicate inadequacy and possible harm from routine treatment with corticosteroids for viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund is a global fund for sustaining the work of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in containing the current coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>It was launched by the Director-General of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on March 13, 2020.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should people who suffer from pollen allergy self-isolate if they develop typical hay fever symptoms?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No, there is no need for people suffering from pollen allergy to self-isolate if they develop their typical hay-fever symptoms. Furthermore, they should continue following the general guidance for social distancing and seek medical advice only if the symptoms get worse and they develop fever or breathing difficulties.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can large doses of vitamin C prevent or help to treat COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>At present, no evidence suggests that taking a massive dosage of vitamin C supplements could help prevent or cure the new disease, COVID-19. In fact, medical health experts say there is limited evidence that vitamin C can even prevent the common cold.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does drinking milk prevent you from getting Covid-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>According to health experts, it is not true to say drinking milk will help fight off the coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Where did coronavirus come from?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The outbreak of this new virus began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Which countries are most-affected by COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As of April 2, the top 10 countries who are most affected by COVID-19 are:</p>
<li>United States</li>
<li>Italy</li>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>China</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Iran</li>
<li>UK</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>Turkey.</li></p>
<p>However, the results are continually changing, depending on reports from the affected countries and regions.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can antibiotics kill the new coronavirus?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Antibiotics can only kill bacteria. They are not capable of destroying viruses.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can drinking water and keeping your mouth moist protect you from contracting COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. Drinking water every 15 minutes to keep your mouth moist or to flush away the virus that has entered your body does not kill the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If I have the antibodies, am I immune forever?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Since the virus is new, it is still too early to rule out and put clarity on how long the level of the immunity can be held, nor how long it could last.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How will I know if I am immune?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>At this rate, the UK government is working with different companies to create the most effective and simple blood tests to help determine whether a person has developed antibodies to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The presence of COVID-19 antibodies would mean that a person has acquired a level of immunity to the disease.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How does the antibody test work in the UK?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>UK Health Secretary Mr Hancock earlier said that the antibody tests could be done by taking a blood sample through pricking one's finger which could deliver results in approximately 20 minutes.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is social distancing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Social distancing is a public health practice that puts space between people to prevent them from coming in close contact with those who are infected with the disease. This practice aims to slow the spread of transmission or reduce opportunities of transmission in a community.</p>
<p>Social distancing includes maintaining a barrier of physical distance which include:</p>
<li>Cancelling group events</li>
<li>Closing public spaces</li>
<li>Avoiding crowds</li>
<li>Working from home, or</li>
<li>Not taking public transportation, including buses, subways, taxis, and rideshares.</li></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is herd immunity?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Herd immunity or 'community immunity' refers to the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease when a large group of individuals in a given population has become immune, especially through vaccination.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does social distancing work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. Social distancing appears to delay the spread of transmission in an effort to contain the outbreak. Studies suggest that this public health measure works, including those from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. By closing schools and banning public gatherings, we can help lower COVID-19 death rates.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is testing essential?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Testing is beneficial in informing infected persons that they are infected. It is one way of knowing how to provide high-quality and person-centred care. Moreover, testing is critical in analysing the most appropriate response to the coronavirus pandemic. It helps us to understand how the disease spreads and take evidence-based strategies that will break the chain of transmission.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there a particular blood group more prone to Covid-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>An early study suggests that there may be a chance that some blood types are at a higher risk of getting infected. Researchers of the said study assessed 2,173 confirmed cases in Shenzhen and Wuhan, where the outbreak originated.</p>
<p>They found that patients with A blood group types were more likely to have been hospitalised than average, while those with an O blood group type were less likely.</p>
<p>In the local population, 32% had a type A blood group, compared with 38% of those in hospital. Meanwhile, 34% of residents had type 0 blood, compared with 26% in the hospital.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will the spread of COVID-19 be affected by changing seasons?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>At present, the World Health Organisation (WHO) firmly states that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is it true that COVID-19 is a man-made virus or an act of terrorism?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a man-made virus nor proof that this is used as biological warfare. Coronaviruses originate in animals and cause illness in animals. However, sometimes they can spread from animals to humans.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will COVID-19 die down in summer?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The virus is completely new. Thus, health experts still need further research to better understand how it will react to warmer weather by examining its behaviour and properties. However, just like any viruses, it is clear that warmer weather does not stop the transmission or growth of the virus. For COVID-19, we cannot expect it to completely disappear by the summer.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How are COVID-19 tests done?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The most common COVID-19 tests involve taking a swab from a person's nose and throat to check for the genetic footprint of the virus. They are called "PCR tests". The first PCR tests were developed very rapidly, within two weeks after the identification of COVID-19. PCR tests are now part of the World Health Organisation's recommended protocol for dealing with the disease.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Where do coronaviruses come from?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals whereby some of them are also capable of infecting humans.</p>
<p>Bats are recognised as natural hosts of these viruses, and several other species of animals are also known to act as sources. For example, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How can people help stop the stigma concerning COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>People can fight stigma by helping and not hurting those that are affected by COVID-19. One way of helping others is by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing evidence-based facts.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does a well-controlled health condition mean?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. Therefore, it is essential to talk with your GP if you have questions regarding your general health and wellbeing, as well as how to manage any health conditions while staying at home.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are the symptoms for COVID-19 different in children than in adults?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No, the symptoms of COVID-19 in children and adults are similar. However, children with COVID-19 have generally presented mild cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhoea have also been reported. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, especially those with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. Hence, there is much more to be learned about how COVID-19 impacts children.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should children wear masks?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If the child is healthy, there is no need for them to wear a mask. Only people who have symptoms of illness or who are providing care to those who are ill should wear masks.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are people with disabilities at higher risk?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Generally, most people with disabilities are not at higher risk of becoming infected with or having severe illness from the new coronavirus. However, some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition and/or other chronic health conditions.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do I need to test my pet for COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Currently, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is community spread?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Community spread means people in a specific area have been infected, including some who are not sure of how or where they got the virus.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What exact temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Coronaviruses generally survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. Currently, we have no direct data for the new coronavirus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation. The necessary temperature would also be based upon particular materials of the surface as well as the environment.</p>
</div>
