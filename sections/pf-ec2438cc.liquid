By then, it felt like life had stopped entirely. I got to know every little part of our house because we always stayed indoors. Whenever we went out, people would stare and make judgmental comments. Family members even questioned our parenting skills. Very few people seemed to understand what we were going through. What I also realised is that we, as a family, had not come to terms with the diagnosis. We had not accepted it; we were in denial.<br><br>Our understanding of autism improved vastly, but I didn't feel it was my duty to educate people about my child or correct their myths. It was so painful, and I would get home and cry my eyes out. We started to avoid busy environments, such as shopping centres, family gatherings and children's parties. It was so exhausting having to explain why your child is different. After all, he doesn't have visible physical disabilities.<br><br>We accepted the diagnosis and learned how to adapt our lives. Autism was part of our lives forever, so there was no plan B. However, you immediately realise that not everyone takes time to understand how you are doing. A few people understood, and they offered help in the form of kind words and checking whether we were okay. Some pointed us in the right direction regarding helpful services and tips. I will forever be indebted to these kind souls.

We had a lot of plans for our boys, including buying a home, helping them build their careers, and travelling the world, among others. But, everything literally froze. We felt so guilty that most of our time was now dedicated to our younger son, yet our older son needed us just as much.<br><br>I still had a full-time job and would juggle work, looking after both boys, hospital and community care appointments and trying to live a normal family life. The good thing was that he was now in a specialist school. They were very supportive and gave us many helpful tips for building routines. Everything took twice as long to do, and we celebrated even the tiniest of milestones.
<br><br>We had a small circle of friends and family who fully understood our situation and were always there to lend a helping hand or give us advice. Our son soon got comfortable with our inner circle. He knew he could just be himself, and no one would judge him, stare at him, or make derogatory comments. You see, even children with autism can read the room and behave appropriately in response.

Just a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have had the courage to write a few lines. However, once I started, I realised that my family's story deserves to be told. Even if it helped just one child and family out there, I would be very happy. Even if it changed one person's attitude about children with disabilities, I would be the happiest woman in the world.<br><br>My son is now thriving in secondary school. He's the most wonderful soul. I hope someday I'll write a book about our journey and the life I wish for him and other children like him. I want a life where he can be himself without fear of judgement or exclusion. I hope to write more articles about our autism journey - the good, the bad and the ugly.
