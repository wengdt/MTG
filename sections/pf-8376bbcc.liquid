<button class="accordion">What are the limitations of online course?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There are some topics where healthcare professionals can only scratch the surface and aren't able to talk through issues with individuals, so they truly grasp the subject matter. A lot of diversity training is done now by eLearning. Still, generally, it doesn't allow space for individuals to explore the concept in an interactive way to allow people to work through their internal dialogues and achieve real change. E-learning should never be the totality of the training provision.

<button class="accordion">How can online course and qualification cut the cost of healthcare and divert resources to more staff and better working practices?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Online course and qualification can save costs on infrastructure and personnel, which can be reinvested in patient services. One of the benefits of e-learning is rapid accessibility. If we release a classroom course, it has to be planned at least six to eight weeks in advance for clinical schedules. With e-learning, staff can access classes immediately. This stops delays in the system and is not reliant on the staff member being available for a specific session.</p>
