However, this year has not been kind to the world. <br><br>As the world grapples with the novel coronavirus, local and international health organisations are exhibiting continued efforts to better understand the disease in an effort to contain the outbreak and find a cure. This global public health emergency continues to threaten the health system, affecting every facet of our daily lives at a higher level.<br><br>In detail, the name "coronavirus" originated from the Latin word corona, which means crown. Coronaviruses are from a large family of viruses that can cause mild to severe respiratory diseases and sometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms. These viruses consist of a core of genetic material, enclosed within an envelope of protein spikes that is similar to a crown. At this rate, the novel coronavirus, now named as SARS-CoV 2, has infected more than 700,000 people worldwide, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths to 33,966.<br><br>As a result, the sudden outbreak instils increasing fear among people of all ages, gender and race, which could be due to the misinformation that has been circulating all over social media platforms, conflicting statements from different health agencies, and the fact that it is a new and developing case that needs further research. Another contributory factor includes human nature. This psychological attribute plays a role in responding to a difficult situation, which serves as a survival guide to help them get through any complexities. To some extent, the global response has been blown out of proportion that leads to harmful stereotypes and unnecessary anxieties. <br><br>Latest statistics show that 19,522 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, after 127,737 tests. As of March 29, the total number of deaths in the country jumps to 1,228. However, the figures stated above are continually shifting. For recent updates, it is essential to follow accurate data statements from your local health authorities.<br><br>Given these points, the Coronavirus Awareness e-learning course aims to build a better public health education on the exact cause and effect, signs and symptoms, and preventive measures for health and social care professionals and the wider community for the implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control practices. <br><br>Unfortunately, no vaccine or treatment is available to prevent you from contracting this disease. International and local health organisations encourage everyone to practise good personal hygiene by frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. It may sound simple, but it is one of the basic preventive measures to protect ourselves and of others. <br><br>In this time of global emergency, the world desperately needs solidarity and humanity amidst this widespread panic. Let us encourage everyone to check the validity of information at all times and to prepare without panicking.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
