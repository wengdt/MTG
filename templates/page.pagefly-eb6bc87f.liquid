<button class="accordion">How do I become a certified online health and wellness consultant?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Some online health and wellness consultant positions require a college degree, and others require a background in healthcare, diet and nutritional training. Generally, wellness consultants who work for a large company or a healthcare agency have a college degree in a health-related field like nutrition or sports medicine.</p>

<button class="accordion">Are online health and wellness coaches legit?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is still no organisation that ensures health and wellness coaches have proper training and are qualified. Anyone can say they are a health coach. And, while someone may be very knowledgeable about health and nutrition, if they haven't received proper training, they may do more harm than good.</p>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between a health coach and a wellness coach?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Health coaching is not an evolution of life coaching; it is a different speciality. Health and wellness coaches help people develop individualised strategies for improving their health, exercise, eating and emotional well-being. Life coaching focuses on an individual's entire life.</p>
