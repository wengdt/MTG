<br>A chaperone must show the same care a good parent would and cannot carry on another role at the same time. The primary responsibilities include: taking action if the child is ill, tired or upset and also making sure that the child has enough breaks, rest and meals.
<br> 
<br>Our Online Chaperone and Child Protection Training Courses will help those aspiring to be chaperones and professional chaperones which are licenced by local authorities to undertake this role. It is essential for professional chaperones to understand their responsibilities, current UK legislation and regulations.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-9e88f437 pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pIvhh gtZHgp" style="background-color: rgb(55, 52, 180);"></div><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-7ff7e5d0 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-3a567ff7" data-pf-type="Column"><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-5a3c3a56"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-f9e75a3c"><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Online&nbsp;Chaperone and Child Protection Training Courses -&nbsp;CPD Accredited with Certificates&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></span></h2></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-f437733a pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-c724b343 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-53e4c724" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-13128279"><div id="collection-component-1598263899924"></div>
