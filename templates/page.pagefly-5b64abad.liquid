<div class="panel">

<button class="accordion">What are the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Diversity is about respecting and valuing people's differences and appropriately treating them. Inclusion is about making sure that people feel comfortable to be themselves, and think that they belong. We recognise our responsibilities in respect of the protected groups specified in the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<button class="accordion">What is equality, diversity and inclusion in the workplace?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Equality and diversity in the workplace mean a lot of things. They're about respecting your staff for their age, gender, race, cultural background, career experience, skills and beliefs.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is inclusion?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p> 'Inclusion' are often used interchangeably, but if you want to get the most out of each of them, you need to know the differences between the two. Whereas diversity is focused on what makes people different, 
inclusion looks at creating an environment where diversity can thrive.</p>
