<button class="accordion">What is Online Public Speaking Training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In traditional public speaking, the audience is often limited to those individuals who show up for the event—the audience is explicit or discrete. In online speaking, you may have a discrete or dispersed audience. These different audience types, along with synchronicity, alter how audience engagement can occur.</p>

<button class="accordion">How does an online public speaking class work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You will still give speeches. Students work independently online as in any online class completing activities such as reading, viewing online materials, writing speeches, posting outlines and/or taking online quizzes are common.</p>

<button class="accordion">What is delivery in public speaking?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Delivery refers to the presentation of the speech you have researched, organised, outlined, and practised. Delivery is essential, of course, because it is what is most immediate to the audience.</p>

<button class="accordion">What are the benefits of taking an online public speaking training course?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Public speaking is an excellent way to break out of your comfort zone and build confidence. Speaking out loud to a class or an even larger group of people is difficult for most people at first. Becoming comfortable and proficient at speaking out loud is a great confidence and self-esteem booster.</p>

<button class="accordion">What causes the fear of public speaking?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The fear often arises when people overestimate the stakes of communicating their ideas in front of others, viewing the speaking event as a potential threat to their credibility, image, and chance to reach an audience.</p>
