<button class="accordion">Who are the health and social care training providers?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Health and social care training providers are the organisation who supplies the training elements for health and social care workers. They are generally a different organisation from the employer, although larger employers sometimes also act as providers. Health and social care training providers will work with employers to ensure that health and social care workers learn the skills necessary for their apprenticeship framework.</p>
<p>If you are looking for healthcare and social care training experts you can trust, then you have come to the right place! </p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What courses should health and social care providers provide?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Health and social care training providers must offer a wide range of courses on a national and local level to guide workers in the health and social care settings along the training pathway, from induction right through to higher level and special focus training.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is health and social care training important?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Health and social care training are a flexible way to learn. Encouraging lifelong learning is a goal for care industry leaders, but many care workers donâ€™t have access to the materials they need. With limited time at work for professional development, online training courses are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How training provided by health and social care training providers work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We understand that shift patterns and long hours can make it challenging to complete a course to a tight schedule. The health and social care training providers combines easy-to-read online theory with a practical placement, whether you are new to the care sector or want to progress in your current career.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the things to consider when selecting a health and social care training provider?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>One of the important things to consider when selecting a health and social care training provider is having both perspectives (client and training providers). This will help gain a clear understanding of what to look for when selecting a training provider.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why training providers must understand the health and social care industry and "day-to-day reality"?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Many training providers are experts in a particular area and industry, especially in the health and social care industry. The best ones know to stay within that industry.</p>
<p>When hiring a training provider, especially in the health and social care sector, make sure they display a deep understanding on how the health and social care industry works, challenges, strategy and the day-to-day reality in which participants operate.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why do health and social care training providers must customise their content?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Customisation is key to active learning unless participants can connect the knowledge to their day-to-day, and practice in a safe environment before going out into the real world of health and social care industry.</p>
<p>When selecting a training provider, insist that any health and social care training provider you choose customises core elements of their training program like case studies, role-plays, examples and terminology.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are training providers for health and social care should measure progress?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Top-ranked health and social care training providers don't merely suggest you measure progress over time; they insist on it. They understand that the real value they deliver is not in how excellent their training is; it's in how great the results are.</p>

<button class="accordion"> What is training in health and social care?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In the same way that training improves an athlete's performance, training of your health and social care employees will improve their performance. Recognised qualifications such as the NVQ in Health and Social Care provide concrete evidence of that training, and the quality of the care that your staff provide.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How important is training in health and social care?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Training improves staff productivity, keeps them motivated, and assures them that they are being valued, thereby improving staff loyalty and retention. ... In conclusion, training aids in providing quality care and better patient experience which is the ultimate goal of any healthcare organisation.</p>

<button class="accordion">As a health and social care training provider, are your training courses accredited?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. As a health and social care training provider, we make sure that all our courses and training are accredited. Once you successfully completed each of our online health and social care training courses, you will be able to download, save and print a quality assured continuing professional development (CPD) certificate. Our CPD certificates are recognised internationally and can be used to provide evidence for compliance and audit.</p>
<p><a href="https://cpduk.co.uk/directory/profile/the-mandatory-training-group"><font color="green"><u>The CPD Certification Service (CPDUK)</u></font></a>accredits all of our statutory and mandatory training courses as conforming to universally accepted Continuous Professional Development (CPD) guidelines.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there an assessment for the health and social care training you provided?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. On completion of each of our health and social care training courses, you need to complete an online assessment (pass mark of 80%).</p>

<p>If you fail on the first try, do not worry. You can take the online test as many times as you need, with no extra charge.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can an employer charge their employees for the health and social care training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Some states may allow employees to make payment for their training costs. However, federal labour law still requires the employer to pay their employees at their regular rate for the hours they spent completing the required health and social care training. If their health care professionals must travel to an off-site location, the employer must pay for their travel expenses.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is health and social care training essential?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Training for health and social care professionals is essential to develop and strengthen their necessary skills and expertise, as well as to provide services in the health and social care settings effectively.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do healthcare and social care professionals get paid for taking health and social care training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Healthcare and social care professionals who are required to participate in a training program, such as health and social care training for work, must get paid for that time. Hence, if the employer requires all new healthcare and social care professionals to attend orientation training, or their current healthcare and social care professionals to attend infection prevention and control training, that time must be paid.</p>
</div>
