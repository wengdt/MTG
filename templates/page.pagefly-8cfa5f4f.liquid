<button class="accordion">How do nurses calculate drugs?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Find out what is in your IV bottle (drug concentration or the number of mL of fluid).</p>
<li> Identify which unit your drug is measured (units/hour, mg/hour, or mcg/kg/minute).</li>
<li> Know the patient's weight in kg if your calculation is weight-based.</li>
<li> Use the universal formula and then divide your final answer by the patient's weight in kg to arrive at mcg/kg/minute.</li>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How are drug dosage determined?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The total daily dosage is calculated from the dose and the number of times per day the dose is taken. The dosage form is the physical form of a dose of a drug. The strength is the amount of drug in the dosage form or a unit of the dosage form (e.g. 500 mg capsule, 250 mg/5 mL suspension).</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Drug volume refers to the volume of distribution that is necessary to contain the total amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that is observed in the blood plasma.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is drug concentration?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Drug concentration is the amount of a drug in a given volume of blood plasma. It is measured as the number of micrograms per millilitre.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you calculate drops per minute?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The drops per minute would be calculated as total volume, divided by time (in minutes), multiplied by the drop factor of 60 gtts/min, which also equals 41.6, rounded to 42 drops per minute.</p>

<button class="accordion">How are drugs calculated for kids?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Most drugs in children are calculated according to body weight (mg/kg) or body surface area (BSA) (mg/m2). It is essential to be mindful in converting body weight from pounds to kilograms (1 kg= 2.2 lb) before calculating doses based on body weight.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is drug dosage calculation important?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Medication calculation skills also make it possible to interpret the instructions written by a physician or prescriber correctly. Also, drug calculations allow nurses to monitor for potential side effects and to make decisions in discontinuing the medication in case of a severe reaction.</p>

<button class="accordion">How to calculate drugs?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Determine in which units your drug is measured (units/hour, mg/hour, or mcg/kg/minute). Know the patient's weight in kg if your calculation is weight-based. Use the universal formula, and divide your final answer by the patient's weight in kg to arrive at mcg/kg/minute.</p>

<button class="accordion">What to use for drug dosage calculations?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Drug dosage calculations require the use of conversion factors. Simplistic in design, this method allows clinicians to work with various units of measurement, converting factors to find the answer. These methods are useful in checking the accuracy of other calculation methods and in acting as a double or triple check. </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is drug dosage calculation important in nurses?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Medication calculation skills also make it possible to interpret the instructions written by a physician or prescriber correctly. Competent numerical and drug calculation skills are essential for nurses as mistakes can put patients' lives at risk.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you calculate medication error rate?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Generally, medication error rate is calculated by dividing the number of errors by the sum of the number of doses given plus the number of omissions and then multiplying the result by 100.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you calculate dopamine infusion rate?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>According to the American Heart Association (AHA), to calculate dopamine infusion rate, multiply 6 times the weight in kg times the desired dose in µg/ kg/min. Divide it by the desired amount of fluid to infuse in ml/h, which provides the amount of dopamine in mg to add to each 100 ml solution prepared.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the formula for drug calculation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A basic formula, solving for x, guides us in the setting up of an equation: D/H x Q = x, or Desired dose (amount) = ordered Dose amount/amount on Hand x Quantity.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the 3 primary drug calculations?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The three primary methods for calculation of medication dosages include dimensional analysis, ratio proportion and desired over have or formula.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the strength of a drug?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The strength of medicine is the amount of active ingredient or drug that it contains. Strengths are usually quantified as milligrams (mg), micrograms (mcg) or grams (g). </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How are drug doses determined?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Prescription drug dosage is based typically on body weight. Drugs come with a recommended dose in milligrams or micrograms per kilogram of body weight, and that is used in conjunction with the patient's body weight to determine a safe dosage.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are drugs measured in?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Most drug dosages are measured by weight in grams, milligrams or micrograms. However, certain special drugs have other metric units that measure properties other than weight.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you calculate drop factor?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Drop factor is the number of drops that it takes to equal 1 mL of fluid when using a specific type of IV tubing. The drop size in an IV set depends on the width of the tubing.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What drugs stay in your system the longest?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Benzodiazepines and MDMA generally flag a urine test for up to 4 days after the last dose. Marijuana stays in the system a bit longer, with amounts being detectable for between 1 and 7 days after last use.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What drugs help with concentration?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Prescription smart drugs, such as Adderall and Ritalin, have the strongest and most significant effects on memory and attention. Synthetic nootropic supplements, such as Noopept and Piracetam, are widely available. However, there is not enough evidence of their effectiveness in healthy adults.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does a drug do to the body?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Drugs affect feelings and moods, judgment, decision-making, learning and memory. They can also cause or worsen other health problems such as cancer, heart disease, lung disease, liver function, mental disorders and infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do drugs act on the body?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The action of drugs on the human body is called pharmacodynamics, and what the body does with the drug is called pharmacokinetics. The drugs that enter the human tend to stimulate specific receptors, ion channels, act on enzymes or transporter proteins. As a result, they cause the human body to react in a particular way.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does drug mean?</button>
