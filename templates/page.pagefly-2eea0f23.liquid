</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Being heard can be one of the most important goals of someone engaged in conflict. Therefore, the ability to resolve a conflict is a skill that individuals can develop and practise.  Knowing how to listen and deploy appropriate communication tactics is determinative of whether a conflict will have a positive or negative resolution. Examine listening skills, appropriate and strategic verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and how to assemble a conflict management plan likely to yield favourable resolutions.

<p>The main goal of negotiation with your opposition is to come to an agreement that benefits all parties. Some other good reasons to negotiate are as follows:
</p>
<li>To understand more about those whose ideas, beliefs, and backgrounds may be different from your own. To resolve a conflict, you must look at the conflict from your opponent's point of view and learn more about this person or group's perspective and motivations.
</li>
<li>To ensure that your relationships with opponents continue and grow. If you make peace with your opponents, you increase your allies in the community. Successful negotiations pave the way for smooth relationships in the future.</li>
<li>To find peaceful solutions to difficult situations. By negotiating, you avoid wasting these resources, and you may make new allies and find new resources.
