<button class="accordion">What is safe handling and administration of medical gases?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As far as possible, the medical gas cylinder store should: Allow cylinders to be stored under cover, preferably enclosed and not subjected to extremes of temperature. Be kept dry, clean and well ventilated (both top and bottom) Have good access for delivery vehicles and reasonably level floor areas.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">WWhat are the precautions to take when dealing with gas under pressure?
</button>
<div class="panel"><p>Use only in well-ventilated areas. Use the smallest amount possible for a particular job. Always wear eye protection (chemical safety goggles) when working with gases under pressure. In some cases, a face shield will also be necessary.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why should you never completely drain a medical gas tank?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Leak test all connections to a cylinder with a soap solution. Caution: Any gas, regardless of its health hazard, may cause asphyxiation by displacing oxygen; Never bleed a cylinder empty. Leave a slight pressure to keep contaminants out.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What must be taken into consideration when storing oxygen cylinders?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Allow cylinders to be stored under cover, preferably enclosed and not subjected to extremes of temperature. Be kept dry, clean and well ventilated (both top and bottom) Have good access for delivery vehicles and reasonably level floor areas.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Which medical gases are flammable?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Fire and explosions can be caused by incidents involving oxygen. It is the most common gas used in health care facilities, and nitrous oxide, which is used frequently as an inhalation anaesthetic.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is compressed gas dangerous?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>All compressed gases are hazardous because of the high pressures inside the cylinders. Even at relatively low pressure, gas can flow rapidly from an open or leaking cylinder. There have been many cases in which damaged cylinders have become uncontrolled rockets or pinwheels and have caused severe injury and damage.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is an example of compressed gas?
</button>
<div class="panel"><p>Any material has a gas which they place under pressure or chilled, and contained by a cylinder is considered to be a compressed gas. These materials are dangerous because they are under pressure. Common examples include compressed air, carbon dioxide, propane, oxygen, ethylene oxide, and welding gases.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does ideal gas mean?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The term ideal gas refers to a hypothetical gas composed of molecules which follow a few rules: Ideal gas molecules do not attract or repel each other. The only interaction between ideal gas molecules would be an elastic collision upon impact with each other or an elastic collision with the walls of the container.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why must the flow of compressed gas be controlled?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Compressed gas has a lot of pressure and can be dangerous if not controlled because all the gas can flow out entirely and quickly.</p><p>
</p></div>
<button class="accordion">What defines the pressure of a gas?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The pressure is a force exerted by the substance per unit area on another substance. The pressure of a gas is the force that the gas exerts on the walls of its container.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you handle a gas cylinder?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Secure cylinders upright with a chain or strap in a proper cylinder cart. Store cylinders at least 20 feet from combustible materials in a dry, ventilated place. Keep oxygen cylinders at least 20 feet from fuel gas cylinders. Ensure valves are entirely closed, and any protection devices are secured.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the medical gas used in hospitals?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The medical gases used in anaesthesia and intensive care are oxygen, nitrous oxide, medical air, entonox, carbon dioxide and heliox. Oxygen is one of the most widely used gases for life-support and respiratory therapy besides anaesthetic procedures.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are examples of medical gases?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Five common medical gases used in hospitals:</p><p>
</p><p></p><li>Medical air</li>
<p></p><li>Oxygen</li>
<p></p><li>Carbon Dioxide</li>
<p></p><li>Nitrogen (Medical Liquid Nitrogen)</li>
<p></p><li>Nitrous Oxide.</li>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why are medical gases considered a drug?
</button>
<div class="panel"><p>They consider medical gases as prescription drugs because their use as drugs is unsafe without the supervision of a licensed practitioner or by properly instructed emergency personnel.</p><p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Is helium a medical gas?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Medical applications: They can use helium gas for respiratory ailments to treat conditions such as asthma and emphysema. Liquid helium also has a medical purpose as they can use it as a cooling medium for magnets and process used in MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do hospitals store oxygen?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Virtually every hospital needs bulk supplies of oxygen and the most economical way to hold a large quantity is in a liquid form. Oxygen liquefies at -183°C and to keep it this cold a specific type of container is needed. Other than cost considerations, there are additional advantages to keeping oxygen in liquid form.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the use of gas in anaesthesia?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Gaseous anaesthetics are a single gas nitrous oxide and volatile fluorinated liquids (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane). They administer these via specific vaporisers that transform the liquids into gases that diminish, and at higher doses, eradicate patient awareness.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Which gas cannot be used as the drive gas?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Nitrous oxide should not be used routinely as a component of the carrier gas any more. A mixture of medical air and oxygen must be acknowledged to be the gold standard. They may use pure oxygen as a carrier gas if medical air or properly performing flow controls for medical air is not available.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between oxygen and air?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The difference between air and oxygen is that oxygen is a pure chemical element. In contrast, the air is a mixture, not an element. Oxygen contains oxygen.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between medical air and oxygen?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Unlike the other piped medical gases, they deliver typically to hospitals in cylinders, and medical air is most often manufactured on-site. They use medical air for a variety of patient applications. Many patients sensitive to oxygen toxicity are delivered air to lower their exposure to oxygen.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the symptoms of getting too much oxygen?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Central nervous system oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you prevent a gas cylinder from exploding?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>How to prevent gas cylinder explosion:</p>
<p></p><li>Keep the gas knob out of reach for children when not using</li>
<p></p><li>Make sure that the kitchen or cooking area is well ventilated for a good flow of air in case of a gas leak</li>
<p></p><li>Educate people around you on gas cylinder safety measures and how to use and handle gas cylinders</li>
<p></p><li>Do not use Meko for long hours while cooking.</li>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can an empty gas cylinder explode?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>People believe that gas cylinders rarely explode and require temperatures of more than 200 degrees. But in most cases, leaking gas results in explosions. Cooking gas has a high expansion rate, and even a spark can result in a blast.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is it right to leave a gas bottle in the sun?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No, the gas bottle will not explode. When the sun is shining, and the temperature rises, the pressure in the gas bottle increases as well. Preferably, store the bottles in a cool place in the shade. Preferably do not place a connected gas bottle in bright sunlight and never near a source of heat.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can a gas stove explode?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Natural gas stoves can explode when the gas builds up without being "lit". The best way to prevent that is to make sure the gas "lights up" into a flame and, if it doesn't, turn the gas off.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can you breathe 100% oxygen?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Pure oxygen can be deadly. Our blood has evolved to capture the oxygen we breathe in and bind it safely to the transport molecule called haemoglobin. If you breathe air with a much higher than average O2 concentration, the oxygen in the lungs overwhelms the blood's ability to carry it away.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the side effects of being on oxygen?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Some patients who use oxygen therapy may have side effects, including:</p>
<p></p><li>Dry or bloody nose</li>
<p></p><li>Irritated skin around the cannula or mask.</li>
<p></p><li>Tiredness or drowsiness</li>
<p></p><li>Morning headaches.</li>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is it right to sleep with oxygen?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Not getting enough rapid eye movement (REM) sleep can also affect how well our immune system functions. Ask your doctor about whether you could benefit from an overnight oximetry study to check your oxygen levels while you sleep. Using oxygen at night may help you to sleep better and improve how you feel in the morning.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do medical oxygen tanks expire?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No. The FDA has directed that expiration date stamps are not to be applied to pressure cylinders filled with medical oxygen. Thus, indicating that oxygen (O2) is safe, stable, and does not expire. The constant reading supply gauge is always visible and shows how much oxygen is in the cylinder.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What colour is a medical oxygen cylinder?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The cylinder body colour of all medical gas cylinders will be changing to white. In the case of oxygen cylinders, the colour code for the shoulder of the cylinder is also white, which means the whole cylinder will be white for medical oxygen.</p>
