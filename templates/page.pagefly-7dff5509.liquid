<button class="accordion">What is CSTF?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The UK Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF) is a collection of recommendations that cover the key statutory and mandatory training subjects for many roles in the health sector. These are minimum expected standards, and many healthcare organisations may have their own more detailed measures.</p>
<p>The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health, safety and wellbeing, social care, education, local government, and many more.</p><a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/collections/all-in-one-day-mandatory-training-courses-cstf-mandatory-training" target="_blank"><font color="green"><u> <b>Click here for more Online CSTF Health, Safety and Welfare Training Courses.</b></u></font></a><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Where did CSTF come from?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Launched in 2013, the CSTF is derived from national guidelines and legislation. It was developed in collaboration with industry experts and professional bodies, such as the Resuscitation Council, the Infection Prevention Society, and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Skills for health continues to maintain and update the framework, and the current version 1.5 was released in October 2018.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why do healthcare providers look out for Online CSTF Aligned Mandatory Training Courses?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As well as providing guidance when they develop training programmes, the CSTF acts as a common standard. Skills for health maintains a directory of healthcare providers who have aligned their training offer to the CSTF. It means that, when they recruit staff, an employer can check if the training that was delivered by a previous employer was CSTF-aligned and thereby decide whether that employee needs to go through induction/refresher training or can begin work straight away. </p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why do agencies and training providers look out for Online CSTF Health, Safety and Welfare Training Courses?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Locum agencies, recruitment agencies or commercial training companies that provide training in the statutory and mandatory subjects, it means that they too can use the CSTF documentation to plan their training programmes. Increasingly, the purchasing consortia (private and NHS), who are buying training services or asking an agency to supply personnel, will specify CSTF-aligned training as a requirement. And when an agency takes a new person on to their books, they can use the directory of healthcare providers in the same way as a direct employer does to check on previous training.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the benefits of taking the Online CSTF Health, Safety and Welfare Training Courses?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If the training that you received from a previous employer was CSTF-aligned, a new employer knows straight away what the content would have covered. So, work with multiple employers and agencies, this will prevent you from having to go through various rounds of induction or refresher training.
