<button class="accordion">What are moving and handling techniques?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Keep your shoulders level and facing in the same direction as your hips. Turning by moving your feet is better than twisting and lifting at the same time. Keep your head up when handling. Look ahead not down at the load once it is held securely and move smoothly.</p>

<li>The nature of the task</li>
<li>The capabilities of the individual performing</li>

<p>Safe manual handling is important because it protects you from the pain and suffering that come with MSD's. Awkward postures, low lifting techniques, and failing to route plan will all increase the risk of injury during manual handling tasks.</p>

<p>If applying these, no man should attempt to lift anything heavier than 25kg and a woman's maximum limit is 16kg. But it's important to take into account other factors which can change the maximum safe weight - such as how high an object will need to be lifted.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What should you do if a load is too heavy or bulky?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Keep loads close to the body. For large, bulky loads, it may be better to bend at the waist instead of the knees to keep the load closer to the body. Do not reach to access a load. Minimize bending by keeping the load between shoulder and thigh height when lifting.</p>

<li>Hand injuries.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the purpose of manual handling?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As an employer, you must protect your workers from the risk of injury from hazardous manual handling in the workplace. Manual handling means transporting or supporting a load by hand or bodily force. It includes lifting, putting down, pushing, pulling, carrying or moving loads.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Which part of the spine takes the most strain?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The most vulnerable areas of the spine are the lumbar (lower back), and the cervical (neck) regions. They are the most mobile, and susceptible to injury. The lower back is also the main weight bearing part of the spine. The spine is supported by muscles and ligaments.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I refuse to lift heavy items at work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You should not be asked to engage in lifting and carrying heavy or large loads without proper training. Do not start a manual handling task if you feel unsafe, or see potential risk to yourself or people around you. Your employer has a responsibility to minimise risk of harm to you while at work.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How can manual handling reduce risk?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Moving and handling reduces risks as it makes the load smaller or lighter and easier to grasp. It also breaks up large consignments into smaller loads, modifies the workplace to reduce carrying distances, twisting movements, or the need to lift things from floor level or above shoulder height and lastly, change the work routine to avoid excessive work rates and tight deadlines.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the most vulnerable part of the body when manual handling?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The variety of injuries can be caused by poor manual handling, by far the commonest is injuries to the back. Why should back injuries predominate? Because the back is the most vulnerable part of the body when poor technique is used: the lower back is subjected to ten times the weight of the object lifted.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the correct technique for lifting?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Bend your hips and knees to squat down to your load, keep it close to your body, and straighten your legs to lift. Never lift a heavy object above shoulder level. Avoid turning or twisting your body while lifting or holding a heavy object.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the most serious consequence of incorrect lifting?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There are many joints where bones meet bones in the back. Normally these joints are quite capable of handling the stresses of lifting. However, improper lifting techniques, even with lightweight objects, can irritate these joints and may cause them to become "locked."</p>
