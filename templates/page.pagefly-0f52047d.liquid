<br>The General Data Protection Regulation is a European Union privacy law that comes into effect on May 25, 2018. It has been years in the making, and is to replace the last major piece of EU privacy law which dates from 1995: a time when Geocities was popular, before Facebook, before Myspace, before even Google.
<br><br>These online GDPR in Health and Social Care training courses aim to highlight the critical aspects of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and how they affect health and social care organisations.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-84ca0475" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-c9b484ca pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-6abac9b4" data-pf-type="Column"><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-e1116aba"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-3813e111">Online GDPR in Social Care Training Courses - CPD Certified E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h2></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-f0c6fbe3 pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-9956f0c6 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-fd669956" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-0475fd66"><div id="collection-component-1604657444687"></div>

<button class="accordion">Why is GDPR vital in health and social care?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The GDPR gives the public more control of their personal data and simplifies and unifies organisations' regulations across the European Union. As social care professionals, you will need to collect and utilise specific data to carry out your duties.</p>
<p>The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health, safety and wellbeing, social care, education, local government, and many more.</p><a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/collections/gdpr-courses-training" target="_blank"><font color="green"><u> <b>Click here for more Online GDPR in Social Care Training Courses</b></u></font></a><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What information is covered under GDPR?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, or online identifier.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Who is exempt from GDPR?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There are restricted GDPR exemptions linked to personal data processing, as detailed here. When data are processed during an activity that falls outside of the remit of European Union legislation, GDPR does not apply to those who process data for personal or household activity.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does GDPR mean for employees?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) respects individuals' rights when processing their personal information. This can be achieved by being open and honest with employees about using information about them and following good data handling procedures.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Who does GDPR apply to?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The GDPR applies to processes carried out by organisations operating within the EU. It also applies to organisations outside the EU that offer goods or services to individuals in the EU.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does GDPR apply publicly available information?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If you can collect the information from the public domain, i.e. a public register, GDPR does not apply.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is a work email address personal data GDPR?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The simple answer is that individuals' work email addresses are personal data. If you can identify an individual either directly or indirectly (even in a professional capacity), GDPR will apply. A person's individual work email typically includes their first/last name and where they work.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you comply with GDPR?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You can comply with GDPR are as follows:</p>
<li>Ensure that key people in your organisation (not just in the IT department) appreciate the importance of GDPR and compliance with it</li>
<li>Document the personal data you hold, where it came from, and who you share it with. To do this, you may need to organise an information audit</li>
<li>Review your current privacy notices and make any necessary changes
Check your procedures to ensure that you can accommodate individuals' rights to be provided with their personal data in a commonly used format and that you can delete their data on request
</li>
<li>Update your procedures so you can handle those requests within the required timescales (usually one month)</li>

<button class="accordion">Does GDPR affect private individuals?</button>
<div class="panel">

</div>
<button class="accordion">What can I do about a breach of GDPR?</button>
<div class="panel">
