<button class="accordion">What are the four types of vaccines?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There are four main types of vaccines:</p>
<p></p><li>Live-attenuated vaccines</li>
<p></p><li>Inactivated vaccines</li>
<p></p><li>Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines</li>
<p></p><li>Toxoid vaccines.</li><p></p></div>

<button class="accordion">Is a vaccine a drug?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Unlike most medicines, which treat or cure diseases, vaccines prevent them.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between a vaccine and a cure?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccines are products that protect people against many diseases that can be very dangerous and even deadly. Unlike most medicines that treat or cure diseases, vaccines prevent you from getting sick with the condition in the first place.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is the importance of vaccines?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccination protects children from severe illness and complications of vaccine-preventable diseases. It may include amputation of an arm or leg, paralysis of limbs, hearing loss, convulsions, brain damage, and death. Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and whooping cough, are still a threat.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What do you mean by immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Immunisation (or vaccination) protects people from disease by introducing a vaccine into the body that triggers an immune response, just as though you had been exposed to a disease naturally.</p></div>
<button class="accordion">What is the purpose of immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Immunisation is the process whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically by the administration of a vaccine. Vaccines stimulate the body's immune system to protect the person against subsequent infection or disease.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is infant immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>At 1 to 2 months, your baby should receive vaccines to protect them from the following diseases: Hepatitis B (HepB) (2nd dose) Diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis) (DTaP) (1st dose) Haemophilus influenzae type b disease (Hib) (1st dose) Polio (IPV) (1st dose).</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between vaccine and immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccination is the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease. While immunisation is a process by which a person becomes protected against a disease through vaccination. This term is often used interchangeably with vaccination or inoculation.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is MMR immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The recommended vaccine for all children is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It protects against three potentially serious illnesses. It is a two-part vaccination, and in most states, you must prove your children have gotten it before they can enter school.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is NHS Immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Immunisation is a way of protecting against serious diseases. Once we have been immunised, our bodies are better able to fight these diseases if we come into contact with them.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">Is the BCG vaccine given in the UK?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In the UK the BCG vaccine is not currently part of the routine childhood schedule. They offer this vaccine to those who are at higher risk of TB.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is in the 6 in 1 vaccine?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The 6-in-1 vaccine used in the UK is also known as DTaP/Hib/HepB/IPV, which stands for 'Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis, Hib, Hepatitis B and Inactivated Polio Vaccine'. The 6-in-1 vaccine includes the acellular pertussis vaccine (the 'aP' in 'DTaP').</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is in a vaccine in the UK?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Traces of five antibiotics may be found in some of the vaccines used in the UK. These are neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin b, gentamicin and kanamycin.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What vaccinations were given in the 60s?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>More vaccines followed in the 1960s — measles, mumps and rubella. In 1963 the measles vaccine was developed, and by the late 1960s, vaccines were also available to protect against mumps (1967) and rubella (1969). These three vaccines were combined into the MMR vaccine in 1971.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What are the two main types of vaccines?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccines can be divided into two main types; live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What ages do babies get immunised?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Before leaving the hospital or birthing centre, your baby receives the first of 3 doses of the vaccine that protects against Hepatitis B.</p></div>


<button class="accordion">What are live attenuated vaccines?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Live attenuated vaccines contain whole bacteria or viruses which have been "weakened". They create a protective immune response but do not cause disease in healthy people.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">Are immunisations important?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccines are the best way we have to prevent infectious disease. A successful immunisation program depends on the cooperation of every person. Vaccinations avoid you or your child from getting diseases for which there are often no medical treatments. These illnesses can result in severe complications and even death.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What are the advantages of immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>If a vaccinated person comes in contact with these diseases, their immune system can respond more effectively. It either prevents the disease from developing or reduces the severity. Immunisation protects not only your family but also others by helping to control severe conditions in our community.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is the role of immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Immunisations, also known as vaccinations, help protect you from getting an infectious disease. When you get vaccinated, you help protect others as well. Vaccines are very safe. It is much safer to get the vaccine than an infectious disease.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is immunisation, and why is it essential?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Immunisation is a simple and effective way of protecting children from serious diseases. It not only helps protect individuals; it also covers the broader community by minimising the spread of disease. Vaccines work by triggering the immune system to fight against certain conditions.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What are the disadvantages of a vaccine?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Some vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely, a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is minimal.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What are the advantages and disadvantages of immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The advantages of immunisation are apparent - they stop individuals from becoming ill. If enough people are immunised, immunisations can also stop pathogens infecting whole populations. It is called herd immunity.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is immunisation, and how does it work?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Immunisation is the process of obtaining immunity to disease through the administration of a vaccine. Immunisation works by triggering your immune system's memory to fight against vaccine-preventable diseases.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What are immunisation examples?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine are examples. Killed (inactivated) vaccines are made from a protein or other small pieces taken from a virus or bacteria. Whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine is an example.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">What is active and passive immunisation?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Active immunisation is when we give you a vaccine, and your immune system kicks into high gear. Also, it sets up a series of reactions in your body to trick your body into thinking that you've had the disease. Passive immunisation is when you get those pre-formed antibodies.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">How do I know if vaccines are safe?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Vaccines are first tested in laboratory studies and animal studies. If the results indicate the vaccine is safe, additional testing in people must be done before the vaccine can be approved.</p></div>
