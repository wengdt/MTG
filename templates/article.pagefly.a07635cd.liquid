<button class="accordion">What is a care home?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A Care Home is a place where personal care and accommodation are provided together. People may live in a Care Home for short or long periods. For many people, it is their sole place of residence, and so it becomes their home, although they do not legally own or rent it. The Care Quality Commission regulates both the care that people receive and the premises.
</p></div>
<button class="accordion">What are the two types of care homes?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There are two types of Care Homes:</p>
<p></p><li>Care Home With Nursing</li>
<p></p><li>Care Home Without Nursing</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is a care home with nursing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Care home with nursing is a Care Home where, in addition to personal care and accommodation, is a place where qualified nursing care is provided, to ensure that the full needs of the person are met.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are examples of a care home with nursing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Examples of Care Homes With Nursing include:	</p>
<p></p><li>Nursing home</li>
<p></p><li>Convalescent home with nursing</li>
<p></p><li>Respite care with nursing</li>
<p></p><li>Mental health crisis house with nursing</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is a care home without nursing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A care home without nursing is a Care Home, also referred to as residential care home.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are examples of care home without nursing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Examples of care home without nursing include:</p>
<p></p><li>Residential home</li>
<p></p><li>Rest home
</li>
<p></p><li>Convalescent home</li>
<p></p><li>Respite care</li>
<p></p><li>Mental health crisis house
</li>
<p></p><li>Therapeutic communities</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is a care setting?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A care setting is a generic UK term for any place where an individual receives health care—e.g., hospital, care home with nursing, care home, or home.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the purpose of a care home?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Care homes provide accommodation and personal care for people who need extra support in their daily lives. Personal care might include help with eating, washing, dressing, going to the toilet or taking medication. 
</p></div>
<button class="accordion">What is assisted living?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Assisted living is for people who need help with daily care, but not as much support as a nursing home provides. Assisted living facilities range in size from as few as 25 residents to 120 or more. Typically, a few "levels of care" are offered, with residents paying more for higher levels of care.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does nursing home mean?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Nursing homes, also called skilled nursing facilities, provide a wide range of health and personal care services. Their services focus on medical care more than most assisted living facilities. These services typically include nursing care, 24-hour supervision, three meals a day, and assistance with everyday activities. Rehabilitation services, such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy, are also available.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between care home and nursing home?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Both types of a home provide accommodation, supervision from staff 24 hours a day, meals and help with personal care needs. However, nursing homes have registered nurses on duty at all times, and they can provide care for people with more complex needs and those who need regular nursing interventions.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is residential care the same as assisted living?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A residential care home provides a higher level of care than assisted living, but a lower level than a nursing home (skilled nursing facility). The most significant difference is that there's more personalised care and staff attention because each home has few residents. Each home may also offer different services.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is respite care?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Respite care involves short term or temporary care of the sick or disabled for a few hours or weeks, designed to provide some relief to the regular caregiver. The regular caregiver is usually a family member but maybe a professional home healthcare worker.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">When should a dementia patient go into a care home?
</button>
<div class="panel">
