<button class="accordion">How is influence significant for leadership?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to work toward the achievement of a common goal which they consider desirable.</p>
<p>The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health, safety and wellbeing, social care, education, local government, and many more.</p><a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/collections/leadership-courses-training-online-leadership-training-courses" target="_blank"><font color="green"><u> <b>Click here for more Online Leadership and Influence Training Courses.</b></u></font></a><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the relationship between leadership and power leadership and influence?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The key difference between the two is the term of effect. Power is the exercise of leadership, and leadership is only defined if you have power. Leadership always involves attempts on a leader to affect behaviour or a follower in a situation. In contrast, Power is not equivalent to influencing another person's behaviour.</p>

<button class="accordion">What do you mean by leadership?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring. Yet, while leaders set the direction, they must also use management skills to guide their people to the right destination, smoothly and efficiently.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is good leadership?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>"A great leader possesses a clear vision, is courageous, has integrity, honesty, humility and clear focus. Great leaders help people reach their goals, are not afraid to hire people that might be better than them and take pride in the accomplishments of those they help along the way."</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you get a leadership attitude?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We came up with a leadership attitude by:</p>
<li>Positive communication</li>
<li>Gratitude</li>
<li>Unite the team</li>
<li>Empower and develop others</li>
<li>Take responsibility</li>
<li>Show empathy.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the most important quality of a leader?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The most important qualities of a good leader include integrity, accountability, empathy, humility, resilience, vision, influence, and positivity.</p>
</div>
