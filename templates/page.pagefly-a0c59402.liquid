<br>Dementia develops when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or a series of strokes. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, but not the only one. The specific symptoms that someone with dementia experiences will depend on the parts of the brain that are damaged and the disease that is causing dementia.
<br><br>These awareness of dementia training courses intend to explain dementia, including its causes and symptoms, and the measures to diagnose and treat the condition. Further, it looks at some of its different types and how to support people with dementia.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-6d4e4403" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-c34e4752 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-7fb1c34e" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-62717fb1"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-fbdc6271">Online Awareness of Dementia Training Courses - CPD Accredited E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-6d12c5b8 pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-2b05685a pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-86cf2b05" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-c5b886cf"><div id="collection-component-1594872465661"></div>

<button class="accordion">What is dementia?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Dementia is an overall term for diseases and conditions characterised by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking skills that affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities.</p>
<p>The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health, safety and wellbeing, social care, education, local government, and many more.<a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/collections/dementia-courses-training-online-dementia-training-courses" target="_blank"><font color="green"><u> Click here for more Online Awareness of Dementia Training Courses</u></font></a></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What do you mean by dementia?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with your daily life. Though dementia generally involves memory loss, memory loss has different causes. Having memory loss alone does not mean you have dementia.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the main cause of dementia?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Not all causes of Alzheimer's disease are known. However,  experts do know that a small percentage can relate to mutations of three genes, passing down from a parent to a child.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the 5 stages of dementia?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The typical progression of dementia disease may be broken down into five:</p>
<li> Stage One: No Impairment</li>
<li> Stage Two: Very Mild Cognitive Decline</li>
<li> Stage Three: Mild Cognitive Decline</li>
<li> Stage Four: Moderate Cognitive Decline</li>
<li> Stage Five: Mid-Stage Dementia.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do doctors test for dementia?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer's and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behaviour associated with each type.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can dementia be prevented?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There's no certain way to prevent all types of dementia – researchers are still investigating how the disease develops. However, there's good evidence that a healthy lifestyle can help reduce your risk of developing dementia when you're older.</p>
