<button class="accordion">What are Equality, Diversity and human rights?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Equality means ensuring everyone in your setting has equal opportunities, regardless of their abilities, their background or their lifestyle.</p>

<p>Diversity means appreciating the differences between people and treating people's values, beliefs, cultures and lifestyles with respect.</p>

<p>Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is equality, diversity and human rights training necessary?</button>
<div class="panel">

</div>
<button class="accordion">How can equality, diversity and human rights be improved in the workplace?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Equality, diversity and human rights can be improved in the workplace by:</p>
<p><li>Identify and prevent unconscious bias</li>
<p><li>Put equality policies in place</li>
<p><li>Mind your language</li>
<p><li>Use objective criteria</li>
<p><li>Be proactive</li>
<p><li>Get advice if needed</li>
<p><li>Watch out for indirect discrimination.</li>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are human rights?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, whatever our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status. We are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination. These rights are all interrelated, interdependent and indivisible.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is equality?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Equality is about ensuring that every individual has an equal opportunity to make the most of their lives and talents. 
It is also the belief that no one should have more reduced life chances because of the way they were born, where they come from, what they believe, or whether they have a disability.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is diversity?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Diversity refers to the existence of variations of different characteristics in a group of people. These characteristics could be everything that makes us unique. It includes our cognitive skills and personality traits, along with the things that shape our identity (e.g. race, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, cultural background).</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How does the Human Rights Act promote equality and diversity?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Human Rights Act provides a legal framework to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality of opportunity for all. </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should equality, diversity and human rights training be mandatory?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>While equality, diversity and human rights are legal issues, and it makes sense to include all employees in training, multiple studies have suggested that mandatory training is less effective. When leaders stressed the importance of attending equality, diversity and human rights training for their self-betterment, other employees were likely to follow.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is it necessary to learn about equality, diversity and human rights?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Because of the knowledge and respect of rights that students gain from this, combined with understanding, respect and tolerance for difference, can empower them to tackle prejudice, improve relationships and make the most of their lives. In our ever more diverse and challenging society, it becomes more important to instil young people with these positive and open-minded attitudes.</p>
