All our online training courses, programmes and qualifications are accredited by the CPD Certification Service (CPDUK).
<br> 
<br>It is fundamental in health and care that the person receiving the care or treatment, i.e. the patient/client/service user agrees to receive it. That is that he or she provides informed consent to receiving the care or treatment.
<br>Our online Consent in Healthcare training courses supports the learners to understand its primary purpose, which is to protect the patient.&nbsp;<br><br>Consent in healthcare is important because it enables you to decide which treatments you do or do not want to receive. Also, informed consent allows you to make decisions with your healthcare provider. This collaborative decision-making process is an ethical and legal obligation of healthcare providers.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-ada50e44" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-d62cada5 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-80dad62c" data-pf-type="Column"><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-6e5c80da"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-668d6e5c">Online Consent in Healthcare Training Courses - CPDUK Certified E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h2></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-cc806c80 pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-580ecc80 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-1ea1580e" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-0e441ea1"><div id="collection-component-1603192622948"></div>

<button class="accordion">What is healthcare consent?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Consent to treatment means a person must permit before they receive any medical treatment, test or examination. They must do this based on an explanation by a clinician.</p>

<button class="accordion">Why is consent necessary in healthcare?
</button>
<div class="panel">It's fundamental to health care that the person receiving the care or treatment – the patient/client – agrees to receive it. That is, he or she provides informed consent to receiving the care or treatment.<p></p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the types of consent in healthcare?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In the medical field, there are two types of consent: expressed and implied. Expressed consent is communicated either verbally or in written form. Simply put, the victim tells you it is okay to assist.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the purpose of consent?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The primary purpose of the informed consent process is to protect the patient. A consent form is a legal document that ensures an ongoing communication process between you and your health care provider.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are written consent and verbal consent in nursing?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Verbal consent – your agreement is given verbally for a treatment or procedure that doesn't carry a significant risk. Written consent – your agreement is given by signing a document for a treatment or procedure that is complex or has a higher risk.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is valid consent?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>For consent to be valid, they must give it voluntarily. A voluntary decision is one that is made freely by a patient in response to an understanding of the treatment options. The decision must be free from undue pressure, coercion or manipulation.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does implied consent mean in healthcare?
</button>
<div class="panel"><p>Implied consent occurs through the actions or conduct of the patient rather than direct communication through words. For example, they can imply informed consent from a patient's nodding of the head, or by them showing up at the agreed-upon time for surgery.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the five features of informed consent?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Obtaining informed consent in medicine is a process that should include: (1) describing the proposed intervention, (2) emphasising the patient's role in decision-making, (3) discussing alternatives to the proposed intervention, (4) discussing the risks of the proposed intervention and (5) eliciting the patient's.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is verbal consent in healthcare?
</button>
<div class="panel">
