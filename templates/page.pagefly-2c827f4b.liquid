<button class="accordion">What is CSTF?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The UK Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF) is a collection of recommendations that cover the key statutory and mandatory training subjects for many roles in the health sector. These are minimum expected standards, and many healthcare organisations may have their own more detailed standards.</p>

The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health, safety and wellbeing, social care, education, local government, and many more.

</div>
<button class="accordion">Where did CSTF come from?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Originally launched in 2013, the CSTF is from national guidelines and legislation. They develop it in collaboration with industry experts and professional bodies, such as the Resuscitation Council, the Infection Prevention Society, and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Skills for health continues to maintain and update the Framework, and they released the current version v1.5 in October 2018.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why do trusts and healthcare providers look out for it?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>As well as providing guidance when they develop training programmes, the CSTF acts as a common standard. Skills for health maintains a directory of healthcare providers who have aligned their training offer to the CSTF. It means, when they recruit staff, an employer can check if the training that was delivered by a previous employer was CSTF-aligned. Thereby, decide whether that employee needs to go through induction/refresher training or can begin work straight away. It saves more time and money in not forcing people to undergo unnecessary training.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What does it mean for you?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Suppose the training that you received from a previous employer was CSTF-aligned. In that case, a new employer knows straight away what the content would have covered. So, work with multiple employers and/or agencies. It will prevent you from having to go through numerous rounds of induction or refresher training. If you're returning to the workforce and need to arrange refresher training, looking for a training provider who is CSTF-aligned would be a smart move. You can even download the CSTF subject guides and see for yourself what the training should cover.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the benefits of the statutory and mandatory CSTF?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The following are the benefits of the statutory and mandatory CSTF:</p>
<li> Provides a national 'benchmark' for the content of statutory and mandatory training</li>
<li> Sets out minimum learning outcomes, frequency of refresher training and links to relevant legislation or expert guidance</li>
<li> Can be used by any healthcare employer in the UK including NHS, independent healthcare providers and educational organisations</li>
<li> Standardised the interpretation and delivery of statutory and mandatory training</li>
<li> Linkages between the framework, eLearning and wired compliance reporting put all the right information in the hands of employers in a new and powerful way</li></p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between statutory and mandatory?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Statutory is relating to the formal write down of rules or laws. Mandatory means, if an action or procedure is required, people have to do it, because it is a rule or a law.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is statutory and mandatory training important?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Employers often describe this as 'essential' or 'compulsory' training, and it ensures staff know to maintain a healthy and safe working environment for themselves and their colleagues.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does it mean by mandatory?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>It is authoritatively ordered, obligatory, compulsory.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does the required mean mandatory?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The phrase "mandatory requirement" is redundant. A mandatory action is something that is required, obligatory, or compulsory.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do I have to comply with the CSTF frequency of refresher training or assessment?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>For healthcare providers, the CSTF frequency of refresher training or assessment is now a requirement for alignment to the CSTF. Alternative frequencies of refresher training or assessment should only be used in exceptional circumstances (e.g. due to a local risk assessment).</p>
</div>

Each framework sets out the core capabilities – the knowledge, skills and behaviours needed – for safe and effective practice. They can use them to commission or design services, education or training, for identifying key skills and knowledge needed and for developing new teams and roles. Also, in recruitment and selection processes, to ensure consistency in training standards and for quality assurance purposes.</p>
