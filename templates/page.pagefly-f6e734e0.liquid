<button class="accordion">What is health housing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Healthy housing is a shelter that supports a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing. Healthy housing provides a feeling of home, including a sense of belonging, security and privacy.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the housing health and safety rating system?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The housing health and safety rating system (HHSRS) is a risk-based evaluation tool to help local authorities identify and protect against potential risks and hazards to health and safety from any deficiencies identified in dwellings. It was introduced under the Housing Act 2004 and applied to residential properties in England and Wales.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the focus of this HHSRS?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>This assessment method focuses on the hazards that are present in housing. Tackling these hazards will make the house healthier and safer to live.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the aim of HHSRS?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The aim of this guide is for non-specialists, in particular, private landlords to help them understand the requirements under the Housing Act 2004 concerning the HHSRS. It helps them identify the type of work that is needed on their properties to conform with the HHSRS.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is a category one hazard housing?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) assesses 29 housing hazards and the effect that each may have on the health and safety of current or future occupants of the property.
