<br><br>Improving mindfulness is about understanding yourself and being “in-the-moment”. Learners will become more mindful of their actions and learn how to express and interpret their present environment. They will create positive connections and increase their self-regulation of attention and personal experiences.
<br> 
<br>Improving mindfulness will provide benefits throughout your professional and personal lives. Improving mindfulness through gratitude, filtering, and active listening will give your participants the advantage of seeing things in a new light.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-023405eb" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-750a8bb7 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-e14f750a" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-ec03e14f"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-97f5ec03">Online Improving Mindfulness Training Courses - CPDUK Certified E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-8bb73f8f pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-a65419db pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-338ba654" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-3f8f338b"><div id="collection-component-1602496782221"></div>
