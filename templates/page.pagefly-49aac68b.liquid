<br><br>Workplace harassment can be based on a variety of factors that differ from the one doing the harassment, such as race, sex, and disability. Experiencing uncomfortable situations in the workplace may be more than an offence against an individual. It can be a crime committed against the law, which is why this topic has become very important for every organisation.
<br><br>Our online Workplace Harassment training courses will give learners the tools to recognise harassment when it occurs. It will help them understand their rights and responsibilities and create a safe environment for all. Through this e-learning course, learners will recognise that everyone must identify harassment and exercise anti-harassment policies.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-3c428851" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-609d3c42 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-f07f609d" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-1c77f07f"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-e9601c77">Online Workplace Harassment Training Courses - CPDUK Accredited E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-88f9c2de pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-aff388f9 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-6e86aff3" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-88516e86"><div id="collection-component-1597815704818"></div>
