<br>Mentoring is a long-term process based on mutual trust and respect. Coaching, on the other hand, is for a short period. Mentoring is more focused on creating an informal association between the mentor and mentee, whereas coaching follows a more structured and formal approach.
<br>
<br>Our Online Coaching and Mentoring Training Courses focus on how to coach your employees to higher performance better. Coaching is a process of relationship building and setting goals. How well your coach is related directly to how well you can foster a great working relationship with your employees through understanding them and strategic goal setting.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-7bdff874" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-641087bf pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-242d6410" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-0b76242d"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-731a0b76">Online Coaching and Mentoring Training - CPDUK Certified E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-a31ddd86 pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-f83afb5b pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-db01f83a" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-dd86db01"><div id="collection-component-1598009292590"></div>
