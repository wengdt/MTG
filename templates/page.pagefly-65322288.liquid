<br>Sepsis is a common and potentially life-threatening condition triggered by an infection which causes the bodyâ€™s immune system to go into overdrive, and if it not treated quickly, it can lead to multiple organ failure and death. It claims more lives than lung cancer, and is the second biggest killer after cardiovascular disease. <br><br>There are an estimated 123,000 cases of sepsis per year in England, and around 36,800 associated deaths. In many cases however, sepsis is avoidable and treatable and early identification is key to successfully treating sepsis.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-cd219c5a" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-0beace72 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-e31d0bea" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-9ae8e31d"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-095c9ae8">Online Sepsis Awareness Training Courses - CPD Accredited E-Learning Courses with Certificates</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-9c5a8741 pf-bg-lazy" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-dbc08495 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-99e6dbc0" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-550799e6"><div id="collection-component-1601438266038"></div>

</div>

<button class="accordion">Does sepsis come on suddenly?</button>

</div>

<button class="accordion">What happens when your body goes septic?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Severe sepsis is when the infection is severe enough to affect the function of your organs, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.
