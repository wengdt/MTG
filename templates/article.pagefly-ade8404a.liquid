It has become a critical part of any company’s investment strategy if they want to continue growing long-term. Training promotes employee loyalty and retention, improve performance levels, and increases employee independence, among many other benefits.<br><br>When it comes to training, outsourcing to a specialist provider has become an increasingly popular choice for many organisations. It is often more cost-effective, provides more expertise, and allows organisations to focus on the business operations instead of facilitating training.<br><br>The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health and social care, education, local government, private and charity sectors.<br><br>We have supported over one million learners to reach their potential through e-learning courses and qualifications using our interactive online learning portal.<br></span></p></div></div><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-e8796b65" data-pf-type="Column"><img sizes="(min-width: 992px) 1200px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) 800px, 400px" data-srcset="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0937/2788/t/33/assets/pf-3e6881e4--Mandatory-Statutory-Training-Providers-Online-Courses-The-Mandatory-Training-Group-UK.jpg?v=1583905824 1200w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0937/2788/t/33/assets/pf-3e6881e4--Mandatory-Statutory-Training-Providers-Online-Courses-The-Mandatory-Training-Group-UK_800x648.jpg?v=1583905824&resized 800w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0937/2788/t/33/assets/pf-3e6881e4--Mandatory-Statutory-Training-Providers-Online-Courses-The-Mandatory-Training-Group-UK_400x324.jpg?v=1583905824&resized 400w" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Statutory & Mandatory Training Courses in Atherton, Greater Manchester - The Mandatory Training Group UK -" title="Statutory & Mandatory Training Courses in Atherton, Greater Manchester - The Mandatory Training Group UK -" class="sc-qZtVr dLIPjF pf-5a6746cd pf-img-lazy" data-pf-type="Image2"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-2b99f09f" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-81ada9e5 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-1581ada9" data-pf-type="Column"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-849e6041"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-8c1581ad">Browse our online mandatory and statutory training courses to further your professional development.</span></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div data-container="true" class="sc-pZopv bjKdkd pf-9343f00c" data-pf-type="Section"><div class="sc-pQQXS iWCqut" style="max-width: 1170px;"><div class="sc-qPjXN eYzxUD pf-e59343f0 pf-r pf-r-eh" data-pf-type="Row" style="--pf-s-lg:15px; --pf-s-md:15px; --pf-s-sm:15px; --pf-s-xs:15px;"><div class="sc-pbYdQ jklmHY pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12"><div class="sc-pkUyL fTyjzF pf-a9e59343" data-pf-type="Column"><div data-pf-type="Custom.HTML" class="sc-pciXn kKVZfa pf-ada9e593"><div id="collection-component-1584087402774"></div>

<button class="accordion">What is mandatory training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Mandatory training is the training that an organisation determines to be essential for safe and efficient practice and to reduce organisational risks and comply with the policies, legislative and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>In health and social care settings, mandatory training is sometimes defined as a compulsory requirement based upon the responsibility for medical, nursing and healthcare staff to work safely and effectively.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is statutory training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Statutory training is the training that is usually required by law or where a legislative body has instructed an organisation to provide training based on specific legislation. Examples of such legislation include the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999.</p>
<p>Statutory training helps to keep health and social care staff up to date with the latest legislation, regulations, guidance and best practice recommendations. Statutory training also ensures that employees have the skills and knowledge to maintain a healthy and safe working environment for themselves, their colleagues and patients/service users. </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the examples of courses offered by mandatory and statutory training providers?</button>
<div class="panel">

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between mandatory and statutory training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Here at The Mandatory Training Group, many people get in touch with us enquiring about the difference between statutory and mandatory training. In practice, we have found that many health and social care providers often describe both types of training as 'essential training' or 'compulsory training', and sometimes 'statutory mandatory training' or simply 'mandatory training'.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between statutory and mandatory training? The majority of healthcare and social care organisations use the term 'mandatory training' as a 'catch-all' to cover both mandatory and statutory training.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the statutory and mandatory training frameworks?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Examples of statutory and mandatory training frameworks include the UK Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF), the Care Quality Commission inspection standards, NHS resolution risk management standards and NHS commitment to meet the criteria for better health.</p>
<p>Our UK Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF) aligned mandatory and statutory training courses provide doctors, allied health professionals, nurses, nursing and care staff with interactive online training resources and end of course assessments. This enables health and social care staff to be compliant with their mandatory training requirements.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why is statutory and mandatory training essential?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Statutory and mandatory training courses are essential because they enable health and social care workers to achieve the standards set by regulatory authorities and meet organisational obligations. Both statutory and mandatory training equips staff with the essential knowledge and skills to work safely and effectively.</p>
<p>Our statutory and mandatory training packages cover all the legislative and regulatory requirements for care workers to work safely and efficiently, as well as minimising litigation.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the employers' obligations regarding statutory & mandatory training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes, it is possible to get a job using online courses. Online courses are sometimes better than the traditional route and even better when both of them work parallel. In this way, we can cop up with different types of the field in the same and can expand our knowledge at a better extent.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the benefits of online training?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>NHS Trusts, private healthcare providers, care homes and other Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulated organisations have a legal responsibility to provide various statutory and mandatory training courses and to ensure that their staff attend. </p>
<p>Statutory training is required to ensure that the organisation is meeting any legislative duties. On the other hand, mandatory training is an organisational requirement to limit risk and maintain a safe working practice.</p>
<p>Our mandatory and statutory training courses help health and social care employers and employees alike to fulfil their legislative duties. These comprehensive courses provide the essential knowledge and understanding as required by regulatory authorities.</p>
