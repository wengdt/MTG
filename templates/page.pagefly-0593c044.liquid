<button class="accordion">Who is a manager?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The definition of a manager is a person responsible for supervising and motivating employees and directing an organisation's progress. An example of a manager is the person in charge of customer service, who deals with customer disputes and oversees and supervises customer service agents.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How can managers support employees?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The best managers know what motivates their employees, and they keep that in mind when their team does a good job. They also act as an offensive line: They remove obstacles and help organise their employees' workload so they can concentrate on the finer points of their job.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What degree is necessary for a manager?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Education requirements for management jobs vary by the company or organisation. Some employers require a bachelor degree or an associate degree, or some post-secondary education.

<button class="accordion">How does bad management affect employees?

</div>
<button class="accordion">Are managers always right?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>All because under him or her being the boss, he is always right. They hire bosses to be leaders and to manage people. Today's managers are more likely to be described as effective, efficient, and well-versed in ethical behaviour practices and working them.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Why are some managers unsuccessful?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>When employees do not assume responsibility, managers don't empower them to succeed and then blame them for any failures. Rather than touting accountability, managers should instead try to show some of their own. Sadly, manager failure is the rule, not the exception.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can managers be friends with employees?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Managers can (and should) be friendly with their employees. They should make conversation and get to know their team members.

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why do managers fail to plan effectively?
</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Seven common reasons why many of them fail to plan are the following: Some managers dislike the constraints of any kind. Managers need to keep options open to encourage creativity and innovation. Taken to an extreme, however, the lack of any practical limitations creates confusion.</p>
