<br><br>Diversity in the workplace refers to an organization that intentionally employs a workforce composed of individuals of varying gender, religion, race, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, and other attributes.
<br><br>Workplace diversity is taking the HR world by storm. More than ever, employers are prioritizing diversity and inclusion initiatives and investing resources into making sure their teams are set up for success.
