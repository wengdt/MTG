<button class="accordion">What are the techniques of safe manual handling?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Keep the load close to the waist. The load should be kept close to the body for as long as possible while lifting. Keep the most massive side of the load next to the body. Adopt a stable position and make sure your feet are apart, with one leg slightly forward to maintain balance.</p>
