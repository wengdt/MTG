<button class="accordion">What do you mean by a call centre?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A call centre is a department or an office in which handles incoming and outgoing telephone calls from both new and existing customers by a team of advisors, otherwise known as agents. It is traditional for companies of a larger size to have call centres for offering customers support.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is a call centre representative?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Call centre representatives are the people you speak with when you call your bank, order a new sweater from a catalogue or make airline reservations. They do everything from assisting people with customer service complaints to making telemarketing calls.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is customer service in call centres?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Customer support and service representatives are those who work in the call centre field, those who receive phone calls from customers who need help addressing a specific issue. Reps will then work to solve the customer's problem either during the first interaction or in a follow-up email or call.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What's your idea of a call centre representative?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>It's the job of call centre agents to listen and understand customer concerns while also providing helpful information. Customer service call centres need to create satisfied customers with every call.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is customer service?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Customer service in the call centre industry typically means providing timely, attentive, upbeat service to a customer. It makes sure to meet their needs in a manner that reflects positively on the company or business.</p></div>
<button class="accordion">Are call centres stressful?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Assisting customers over the phone can sometimes be tough. The call centre environment, like any other jobs, may cause stress to the representatives, especially if some quotas and standards need to be met. Encountering difficult customers can also be a factor.</p></div>
<button class="accordion">Is it hard to work in a call centre?</button>
