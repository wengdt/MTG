<button class="accordion">What is anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Anaphylaxis is caused by an overreaction of the immune system to a particular allergen. Triggers may be different for each person, but the most common triggers are peanuts, insect stings, latex, shellfish and eggs, and medications such as penicillin.</p>
<p>The Mandatory Training Group is the leading UK provider of accredited statutory and mandatory training courses for all sectors, including health, safety and wellbeing, social care, education, local government, and many more.<a href="https://www.mandatorytraining.co.uk/collections/anaphylaxis-courses-training-online-anaphylaxis-training-courses" target="_blank"><font color="green"><u> <b>Click here for more Online Anaphylaxis for Nurses Training Courses</b></u></font></a></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What happens when you have an anaphylactic reaction?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Anaphylaxis causes your immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. Your blood pressure drops suddenly and your airways narrow, blocking breathing. Signs and symptoms include a rapid, weak pulse; a skin rash; and nausea and vomiting.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What steps should be taken if the nurse suspects anaphylactic shock?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Nursing interventions for the patient are:</p>
<li> Monitor the client's airway. Assess the client for the sensation of a narrowed airway.</li>
<li> Monitor the oxygenation status. Monitor oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas values.</li>
<li> Focus breathing</li>
<li> Positioning</li>
<li> Activity</li>
<li> Hemodynamic parameters</li>
<li> Monitor urine output.</li>

</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the management of anaphylactic shock?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The first step for treating anaphylactic shock will likely be injecting epinephrine (adrenaline) immediately. It can reduce the severity of the allergic reaction. At the hospital, you'll receive more epinephrine intravenously (through an IV). You may also receive glucocorticoid and antihistamines intravenously.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do you assess anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>To help confirm the diagnosis:</p>
<li> You might be given a blood test to measure the amount of a particular enzyme (tryptase) that can be elevated up to three hours after anaphylaxis.</li>
<li> You might be tested for allergies with skin tests or blood tests to help determine your trigger.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the five most common triggers for anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Common anaphylaxis triggers include:</p>
<li> foods – including nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fruits</li>
<li> medicines – including some antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin</li>
<li> insect stings – particularly wasp and bee stings</li>
<li> general anaesthetic</li>
<li> contrast agents – dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans</li>
<li> latex – a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>H1 antihistamines — Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and there is no known equivalent substitute. H1 antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine or cetirizine) relieve itch and hives.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the signs of anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The signs of anaphylaxis include:</p>
<li> Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin</li>
<li> Low blood pressure (hypotension)</li>
<li> Constriction of your airways and a swollen tongue or throat, which can cause wheezing and trouble breathing</li>
<li> A weak and rapid pulse</li>
<li> Nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea</li>
<li> Dizziness or fainting.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does anaphylaxis get worse each time?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Allergic reactions are serious, and the severity can be different each time. It is essential to pay attention to early symptoms, even if they seem mild, especially if you have reacted in the past.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can you have a mild anaphylactic reaction?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Anaphylaxis is defined by several signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, which occurs within minutes, or up to a few hours, after exposure to a provoking agent. It can be mild, moderate to severe, or severe. Most cases are mild, but any anaphylaxis has the potential to become life-threatening.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can stress cause anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>When you're all stressed out, your body releases hormones and other chemicals. One of them is histamine, the powerful chemical that leads to allergy symptoms. While stress doesn't cause allergies, it can make an allergic reaction worse by increasing the histamine in your bloodstream.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the four types of anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The four types of anaphylaxis are the following:</p>
<li> Immediate Hypersensitivity (Anaphylactic Reaction) These allergic reactions are systemic or localized, as in allergic dermatitis (e.g., hives, wheal and erythema reactions)</li>
<li> Cytotoxic Reaction (Antibody-dependent)</li>
<li> Immune Complex Reaction</li>
<li> Cell-Mediated (Delayed Hypersensitivity).</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How can you reduce your exposure to allergy triggers?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>To reduce your exposure to the things that trigger your allergy signs and symptoms (allergens):</p>
<li> Stay indoors on dry, windy days. The best time to go outside is after a good rain, which helps clear pollen from the air</li>
<li> Delegate lawn mowing, weed pulling and other gardening chores that stir up allergies</li>
<li> Remove clothes you've worn outside and shower to rinse pollen from your skin and hair</li>
<li> Don't hang laundry outside — pollen can stick to sheets and towels</li>
<li> Wear a pollen mask if you do outside chores.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long does anaphylaxis occur after eating?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Symptoms usually appear within minutes to a few hours after eating a food, swallowing medication or being stung by an insect. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, including an injection of epinephrine and a trip to a hospital emergency room. If it isn't treated properly, anaphylaxis can be fatal.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What does anaphylaxis feel like?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Anaphylaxis causes your immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. Your blood pressure drops suddenly and your airways narrow, blocking breathing. Signs and symptoms include a rapid, weak pulse; a skin rash; and nausea and vomiting.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Which drug can reverse the effects of anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Epinephrine: Epinephrine is the only medication that can reverse severe anaphylactic symptoms. It is available by prescription. Monitor for late-phase anaphylaxis which can occur in up to 20% of acute anaphylaxis and can be more difficult to treat.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the treatments for anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>During an anaphylactic attack, you might receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if you stop breathing or your heart stops beating. In anaphylaxis, you might also be given medications, including:</p>
<li> Epinephrine (adrenaline) to reduce your body's allergic response</li>
<li> Oxygen, to help you breathe</li>
<li> Intravenous (IV) antihistamines and cortisone to reduce inflammation of your air passages and improve breathing</li>
<li> A beta-agonist (such as albuterol) to relieve breathing symptoms.</li>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Does drinking water help anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Water has the power to regulate your histamine levels. It does not mean drinking water can act to prevent or treat an allergic reaction, but it's good to know that avoiding dehydration by drinking water will help to maintain normal histamine activity.
</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will benadryl stop anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Seek emergency treatment right away. In severe cases, untreated anaphylaxis can lead to death within half an hour. An antihistamine pill, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), isn't sufficient to treat anaphylaxis. These medications can help relieve allergy symptoms but work too slowly in a severe reaction.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are nursing interventions and rationales towards anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Interventions and rationales towards anaphylaxis include:</p>
<li> Administer epinephrine or EpiPen autojector if available</li>
<li> Remove antigen/causative allergy</li>
<li> Initiate IV access and maintain patency</li>
<li> Monitor airway and oxygenation status; prepare for intubation or tracheostomy if necessary to maintain airway and oxygen saturation</li>
<li> Perform CPR if necessary</li>
<li> Position patient upright in high-Fowler's position if conscious</li>
<li> Monitor vital signs; assess for signs of shock</li>
<li> Administer medications as appropriate</li>
<li> Epinephrine, Diphenhydramine and Albuterol</li>
<li> Educate patients regarding avoidance of allergens; how to use EpiPen.</li><p></p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Does EpiPen stop anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>EpiPen is an injection containing epinephrine, a chemical that narrows blood vessels and opens airways in the lungs. These effects can reverse severe low blood pressure, wheezing, severe skin itching, hives, and other symptoms of anaphylaxis.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is anaphylaxis an emergency?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, including a prompt injection of epinephrine and a trip to a hospital emergency room. Improper treatment of anaphylaxis can be fatal. Certain people are more at risk of anaphylaxis.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I administer my EpiPen to someone else having anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Federal legislation permitting the use of any available epinephrine, whether designated or undesignated, is needed to help ensure epinephrine is available when and where it's needed.</p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Why would an EpiPen not work on anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The EpiPen is meant to deliver medicine right into the muscle so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream as quickly as possible. For patients who don't deliver it correctly or for whom the needle is too short of reaching the muscle, the EpiPen won't do its job correctly.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What happens if you use an EpiPen and don't need it?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>For epinephrine to work correctly, it must be injected into the thigh muscle. The greatest risk of an accidental or an incorrect injection is that injecting the epinephrine elsewhere can delay or impair the effectiveness during a time-critical emergency.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are the procedures in treating anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>RN assesses patients and notes evidence of anaphylaxis. Percentages noted in parenthesis indicate the likelihood of having this symptom as an indicator of impending anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>Evidence of developing anaphylaxis includes:</p>
<li>Skin Changes such as flushing, diffuse or local erythema, angioedema, urticaria, itching, especially around eyes, mouth, lips, tongue, genitals, palms and soles (80 to 90%)</li>
<li>Dyspnea, cough, wheeze, chest tightness, or difficulty speaking (70%)
</li>
<li>GI symptoms (45%)</li>
<li>Hypotension (defined as a systolic pressure (90)</li>
<li>Agitation, lightheadedness, sense of doom, syncope.</li><p></p>

</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there a long-term treatment for anaphylaxis?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Unfortunately, in most other cases, there's no way to treat the underlying immune system condition that can lead to anaphylaxis. But you can take steps to prevent a future attack and be prepared if one occurs.
</p>
<li> Try to avoid your allergy triggers</li>
<li> Carry self-administered epinephrine.</li><p></p>
